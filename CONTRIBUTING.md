1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone Locally**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. **Create a New Branch**: Branch off from the `main` branch using a
   descriptive name for your changes.
4. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes, adhering to the coding standards
   and architectural patterns used in the project.
5. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes using clear, concise commit messages
   that follow the guidelines below.
6. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
7. **Open a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request from your fork back to the
   original repository. Describe your changes and their impact.

## Guidelines

- **Code Quality**: Contributions should be well-written and maintainable.
  Ensure your code is clean and well-documented.
- **Testing**: Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work as expected and
  do not negatively impact existing functionalities.
- **Modular PRs**: Keep your pull requests focused and modular to facilitate

Examples:

- `Add error parsing logic to enhance detection`

- `Update README to include setup instructions`

## Automated Checks

We use GitHub Actions to automatically check all pull requests:

- **Linting**: Ensures code style consistency.
- **Unit Tests**: Validates that new changes pass all existing and new tests.
- **Integration Tests**: Checks that the action works as expected in an
  integrated environment.
